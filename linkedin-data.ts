As I walked through the doors of Priyadarshini College, I could feel the palpable energy and enthusiasm in the air, signaling the beginning of a transformative journey for these students.\n\nI extend my heartfelt appreciation to the authorities of Priyadarshini College for their warm welcome and unwavering support in organizing such a impactful event.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the dedication and passion of the student volunteers who selflessly devoted their time and efforts to ensure the smooth execution of the event.\n\nThroughout the day, the sessions were filled with insightful discussions, engaging activities, and practical tips on enhancing soft skills and nurturing one's personality. From effective communication to time management, from leadership skills to emotional intelligence, I covered a wide range of topics that are essential for personal and professional growth.\n\nOne of the highlights of the event was the interactive workshops where students had the opportunity to actively participate and apply the concepts they had learned. These hands-on activities not only reinforced their understanding but also instilled confidence in their abilities to implement these skills in real-world scenarios.\n\nI extend my gratitude to AICTE  and Priyadarshini College of Engineering Nagpur for their invaluable support.\n\nTogether, let us continue to strive for a future where every individual has the opportunity to fulfill their potential, irrespective of their background.\n\n—-The campus is absolutely beautiful spread over 75 acres.

A smart Raspberry Pi is charged by using a micro-USB charger. A power supply of 12 volts is provided where temperature and heart rate sensors continuously monitor.\nWhen the victim wearing the model as an accessory is in danger, any of the sensors get activated as the conditions exceed the threshold level and the message will be sent automatically to the family/police/friends whose contact information is hardcoded.\nA particular keyword will trigger the alert system and the message will automatically be sent to the concerned.\nIn case the button cannot be pressed in the rush of the situation, the temperature and the heartbeat sensor sense if the parameters are above the threshold level and activates the system.\nKeeping in mind that the physical parameters are subject to changes, a voice activator is also embedded into the design. When a pre-decided word is said out, the device shall recognize the word and activate the system.",
